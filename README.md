# Ozon

The Ozon Projects aims to eliminate the need to create multiple projects over different platforms. Ozon wants to provide a unifying software to create git, cloud and more projects with one simple command. 

## Installation

## Usage example

## Development Setup

You need a working go installation. Ozon is using go modules instead of GOPATH. 

```
git clone https://github.com/Ozon-Project/ozon.git
cd ozon
```

If you want to test your configurations with the cli you need to use the following commands.

```
go build
go install
```
Now you are able to test your changes with the standard cli tool of ozon.
